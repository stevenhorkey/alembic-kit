Partial Perspectives is a blog and tool collection that was born out of a need to answer two questions...

**1. How do we make sense of the world we find ourselves in? And...**

**2. How can we trust our answers to the first question?**

_If I'm confident about anything, it's that humans are extremely fallible, full of bias, addicted to approval, and easily deluded into justifying whatever they already do and believe._

And if you think you're somehow beyond that, _I dare you to think again._

This site is thus an attempt to utilize tools and lessons from data-backed sources in the psychological research literature, as well as ones found in more esoteric ancient wisdom traditions. I feel like it would be a great loss to neglect either, and to not let them inform one another.

Basically, everyone can have a seat at the table here, but no one has a pulpit to preach absolute claims about what is happening here or prescriptions on how we should each live. 

You're an adult - you can decide that for yourself.

But if you're like me, your goal is to create a more fulfilling life rooted in authenticity, ingenuity, careful thinking, connection, and humility.

**Here you'll find a variety of exercises that you can complete and save for later from a wide range of sources, including videos, courses, podcasts, books, etc.**

**Overtime, you'll also find courses that mix and match those exercises in unique ways to better guide you to achieving the goals you want to focus on in your life.**

I certainly don't have everything figured out, no one person can. *But maybe that's why we're here... to figure ourselves out.*

Take a look below to see some of the latest exercises, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or recommendations.

Lastly, take care of yourself and take care of others... but in that order.
