excerpt: "Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the ball rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it."

Partial Perspectives was started out of a need to answer two questions...

**1. How do I create an organized space to document and track my inquiry into life. And...**

**2. How do I organize and share everything I'm learning and have learned from all the podcasts and audiobooks I'm consuming.**

What you'll find here is not only exercises that you can complete and save for later from all your favorite podcasts and books.

But you'll also find courses that mix and match those exercises in unique ways to better guide to you the goals you want to focus on in your life.

I certainly don't have everything figured out, no one person can. *But that's why we're here... to figure ourselves out.*

Take a look below to see some of the latest exercises, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or recommendations.

Take care of yourself and take care of others... but in that order.
