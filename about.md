Hi, I'm Steven, and I'm the creator behind this site.

Lastly, some people ask for more info about me, so I figure I may share... 

More than anything, I'm just a curious guy. 

I'm also a singer and multi-instrumentalist, an avid reader, meditator, and self-experinter.

I recently graduated with my B.Sci. in Neuroscience & Cognitive Science from the University of Arizona and do freelance software and music production for the majority of my income.
