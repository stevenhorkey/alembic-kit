Bring to mind everything you want, but don't have...

Maybe it's a certain type of relationship, a job or business you love, a nicer house, a higher income... anything.

Now what does it say about you given the fact that you don't have those?

If you're in a period of your life that's grounded in non-attachment, patience, self-awareness, and love for the process, your answer may be "Nothing. I may acquire those things through sincere action and fortunate means, but it doesn't say anything about my value or worth as a person."

Now, if you read that last sentence and thought "Shit, that would have been a nice thought to have," I'm right there with you.

Lately I've been identified with my achievements, or perceived lack-there-of, and I've been extremely harsh on myself.

"I should be farther along... I shouldn't have made that mistake... I should be a better ___... blah blah blah."

This is entirely an issue of perspective, but continue down that path far enough and one begins to consider self-sabotage, self-harm, or even suicide.

And though I regret to share it, I've flirted with the latter far more than I care to admit.

It, however, is the cold, honest truth.

And if we find ourselves wishing we could feel a bit more of what some may call "self-compassion" or "self-love," than we have to own our truth, be brutally honest, and admit that if we aren't happy, it's our responsibility to become so.

Today's exercise is simple, though I genuinely believe it to be one of the most important and impactful.

You will... 

1. Sit down for however long you can manage. 
2. Dispose of all distractions. 
3. And consider four phrases you will repeat over and over, either aloud or quietly to yourself.

No, this isn't positive-thinking B.S. touted throughout the self-help industry. This is a legit, research backed strategy to improve the relationship you have with yourself, with others, and with the world at large **(cite)**.

Yes, you can add or subtract any number of phrases, but 3-5 is a good amount because anymore begins to become a memorization game instead of the practice we are aiming for.

Traditionally, one starts with directing the phrases toward themselves, then a loved one, an aquitance, an enemy, the town, the country, the world, and finally the universe. 

But if you could really use a helping-hand from yourself right now, feel free to only direct them towards yourself. You'll understand why that's not selfish in due time ;)

*One last thing... this is a practice, not a one-time cure. Just like the fact that no one goes to the gym and feels excited or successful every time they go, overtime they build up the results they are looking for.*

It's amazing how similar our brain is to a muscle. The mind runs in habits, and if you can consciously train it, it will follow.
