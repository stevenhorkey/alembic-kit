**Bring to mind some goals you have for your life...**

Maybe it's to raise and be part of a family, start that business you've always wanted, sell X number of paintings, release that album, finish that degree, go on a pilgrimage... you get my point.

**It doesn't matter what it is.** All that matters is that it is compelling enough to you that it actually sticks in your mind, and probably has stuck in your mind for quite some time. Otherwise, it's probably not worth your time, and if you're honest with yourself, you probably already know that. 

Now, try to consider that goal, and where you're currently at in relation to it.

Did you just swallow your pride in intimidation? That's okay, me too. But the fact that our goals may seem *"oh so far away"* isn't something to be worried about.

Instead, **we should worry about what we're going to do today to take us in the right direction.** And even more importantly, we should ask ourselves *"What habits would I need to instill that would make this goal inevitable?"*

"But I don't know where to start..."

Ah yes, I figured you may say that. 

The truth is, we don't always need to know where to start or know how to do something. Often, we can just simply start, pay attention, ask others who are further along our path than us and keep trying.

But even that isn't always so obvious. So, through the following exercise, we're going to try to create some more clarity.

Below you'll find some charts where you can list your long term goal, and then break it down into smaller timelines starting with one year, and working your way to today. Be realistic but don't hold yourself to low standards either. What feels potentially doable if you pushed yourself a bit? If you were 10% more capable than you think, what would you write down? If you aren't sure how to break your goal down further, do some googling and perhaps be a bit more realistic.

You can create as many of these "action plans" for each of your goals as you want, but honestly... try to stick to between three and five. Why? Because any more than that and you probably need to think about your priorities. You can only do so much with your life and the limited number of years in it. Repeatedly guide your focus to the most important things and along the way your bound to do some of the other fun and interesting things too.

However, before you take some time to do this, I encourage you to keep another question in mind. *"What regular habits would create the lifestyle that I would find most fulfilling?"* This is important because, as every wise sage will tell you, **fulfillment is found in the process and not the destination.** Though this may seem like a trope, it's absolutely fucking true. Both you and I know it. 

So if your goal is to "be a published and famous author" yet daily writing doesn't sound enticing to you at all, you may want to reconsider your goal. If you find yourself in this situation, you may be chasing some ideal, identity, or expectation that you've picked up from your upbringing, society, and god-knows where else. 

With that said, jump right in. Here's another thing both you and I know... **we aren't going to get very far without actually putting in the time and careful thought that this exercise requires.** You owe it to yourself. *Just do it.*
