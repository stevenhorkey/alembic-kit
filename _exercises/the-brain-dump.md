description: I know you have a million-and-one reasons as to why you can't do everything you want to in your life.

This is likely going to be really fun or emotionally difficult for you. For 20 minutes, you're going to write down everything you want to do before you die.

No, you don't have to be "realistic."

In fact, I would encourage the exact opposite. With no limitations, what are all the things you want to do before you die? These can be trivial or substantial - it doesn't matter.

The only thing that does matter, is that you are real with yourself, and at the end, the prospect of doing all these things sparks a fire of aliveness inside of you.

Retorts have the "cap" and the "cucurbit" made into one. The anbik is also called the ra æs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.
